# How to contribute this extension?

You can fork this repository and you can modify the snippet formats which is located in <code>src/templates</code>

## Contribution Guide

1. Fork & Modify the files which is located in <code>src/templates</code>
2. Push it and send a PR.
3. We will initiate a code generation which will build all the templates into respective snippet format with some naming conventions. This should also create the readme file automatically. (We are planning to make this process easier, currently creating an vscode-snippet generator package, once its been completed. This process will be seemless.)
